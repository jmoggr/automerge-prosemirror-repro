`pnpm install`: install the dependencies

`pnpm dev`: run the client and sever. The client should be available on http://localhost:5173/

To reproduce the issue:
- create an inline KaTeX node with `Mod-m`
- add some content to that node
- reload the page

To reset the document state, restart the server.
